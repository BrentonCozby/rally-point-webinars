        <h2 class="title">How To Assemble Parts Into An Excellent Presentation</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/enews/webinar_step_by_step.gif" alt="webinar_step_by_step" /></p>
        <p><br />The above slide, from PM College's presentation, "A 5-Step Process Linking Project Management Competency to Improved Business Performance," does just that. This was the concluding slide after "Measure Improvement." The presentation initially
            displayed just the first arrow and then added the others one-by-one after elaborating on each point.<br /><br />• From Context to Concept to Reality: Sometimes the presenter has a model or concept to share. In this example presentation, "Building
            a Value Proposition that Sells in a Recession," Paul Collins, Managing Partner at Equiteq, LLP, shared a model for building value propositions that receive premium pricing in a down market.<br /><br />He set the context for this important
            element by reviewing the essential elements of a professional services firm, before isolating one—the value proposition—and discussing it:<br /><br /></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/enews/webinar_concept_reality.gif" alt="webinar_concept_reality" /></p>
        <p><br />As the webinar progressed, he discussed each tier of his model and then provided real-world examples of how to climb the pyramid to get to value creation. He did an excellent job and—with some help from a British accent—he made it must-see
            material.<br /><br />Consider whether your presentation centers on a key model. If it does, this structure will serve you well.<br /><br />• Make the Argument: Put on your Johnny Cochran shoes for this one. If you have a point to make, you
            can structure your presentation in whatever way makes the most compelling argument. You can fill it with drama and flair, numbers-backed evidence, logical analysis or anything else.<br /><br />In this example, Leads360 provides Lead Management
            Software (LMS) that compliments Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. Their LMS produces terrific results for realtors, colleges, and brokers, but it's not well known and can be viewed as unnecessary.<br /><br />Leads360 made a compelling
            argument in the presentation title itself: "Where Good CRMs go Bad." Their point was that while CRMs are good, they do have their shortcomings. Certain companies need a focused, specialized, and straightforward tool for critical tasks, like
            converting leads to sales.<br /><br /></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/enews/webinar_argument.gif" alt="webinar_argument" /></p>
        <p><br />As an example of flair and fun, the above slide brought a unique perspective to the point: Specialists produce better results—just look at the Track & Field world records. Not a single world record is held by a decathlete. Specialists hold
            each one.<br /><br />• Give a Taste and Show How It's Done: My friend Mark Levy, author of "Accidental Genius: Revolutionize Your Thinking Through Private Writing," delivered a terrific webinar on writing compelling case studies. His case
            studies are like no one else's. Before fully going into how to create them, he gave the audience a sample of what compelling case studies look like.<br /><br /></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/enews/webinar_show_tell.gif" alt="webinar_show_tell" /></p>
        <p><br />The above slide and story, along with a number of others, made the case. Once you were hooked on wanting one for your own business, Mark walked through the linear process of how to create them.<br /><br /><strong>The Finish</strong><br /><br
            />Most presenters give a summary and then hold a question-and-answer session. Do the Q&A first. This lets you end on a powerful note instead of with an unpredictable (or planted) final question.<br /><br />For the summary, restate what your
            compelling vision was and have the audience look down at their reasons for joining. Return them to what brought them to the presentation. Then, in the final minute, recap what you covered and paint a picture of what's now possible for them
            after having spent an hour with you.<br /><br /><strong>Moving Forward</strong><br /><br />A blank slide deck can be frustrating and time-consuming. Knowing what structures are available to you can make it easier to create your presentation.
            Kids don't worry about playing with a Mr. Potato Head. They pop on a hat, eyes, ears, arms, and shoes. You can now do the same.</p>
